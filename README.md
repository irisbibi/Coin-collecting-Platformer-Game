# Coin-collecting-Platformer-Game

The user moves with direction arrows and tries to dodge obstacles that are falling from the sky. There will be platforms, so you have to jump to platforms. If you fall, you die. Meanwhile, there will be coins which the player can choose to collect. After collecting a certain amount of coins, then we will go to the next level where the objectâ€™s speed and amount will increase. The levels will get harder eg the platforms will start moving or disappear and generate in a new location. 
 
The player presses one of the direction keys, the player object on the screen would move in that direction. Different shapes/objects will fall from the sky. The player will use the updownleftright buttons to dodge said objects. The objects will fall progressively faster and faster as various time marks are hit. You try to collect coins while objects fall. (will have to think about how to place coins and obstacles in such a way that a path actually exist)
